# char_stack.h

This file was 'pilfered' from the fli project early on, due to its potential
use in more general cases. It is a (very) basic implementation of a linearly
linked array style stack for characters. It features a conditional compilation
define for debugging that provides a printall routine and smaller node arrays.
